## 2.5.1 - Hex and RGBA Colors

### Part 1 - Hex Colors

1. In index.html, add class attributes to each div on lines 14-21.
2. Select the classes in style.css and give them a background-color using a hex color value.
3. Add more divs in the HTML to add a pattern on the page.

### Part 2 - RGBA Colors

Use RGBA custom colors to create primary, secondary, tertiary colors. TRY NOT TO USE AN RGB COLOR PICKER FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT!

1. For each color, create a class in CSS and connect it to the HTML. **(For colors with two names, use camel case, ex: yellowOrange, redOrange, redViolet...). You cannot create a class like "yellow orange". CSS will think these are two separate classes.**
2. Using the RGBA color format, put the correct color values to get the color listed for primary and secondary colors.
3. Complete fill in colors using RGBA for tertiary colors.

Challenge: Put a background on the entire body using a lightgray RGBA color that is halfway transparent.
